## Star Wars + GraphQL / Apollo / React

### Server Dependencies
- `express`
- `body-parser`
- `axios`   
- `express-graphql`
- `cors`

### Client Dependencies
- `apollo-boost`: Package containing everything you need to set up Apollo Client
- `react-apollo`: View layer integration for React
- `graphql-tag`: Necessary for parsing your GraphQL queries
- `graphql`: Also parses your GraphQL queries

### API we're using
- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)

### Documentation Reference
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/)
- [Apollo + React](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [How To GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/)

### Project Summary  
In this project we will use GraphQL Query Language to structure our data on the server and Apollo to interact with GraphQL on the client (app). We will interact with a traditional RESTful API `Star Wars` and translate it into GraphQL.  
For basic styling and organization we have some files and folders provided for us. In this step, lets get familiar with the structure.  
`server/graphql/model.js` is where our data for this project is stored, and it was pulled from the [Star Wars](https://swapi.co/) API.
